## Project: E-commerce Scraping Platform - Week 1 Day 4

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### 1. **NavigationMapperBrowserless Migration**
- Successfully migrated from NavigationMapper to NavigationMapperBrowserless
- Added full backward compatibility methods:
  - `mapSiteNavigation()` - wrapper for extractNavigation()
  - `mapSiteTaxonomy()` - filters out product data 
  - `close()` - alias for cleanup()
  - `closeAnyPopups()` - popup handling utility
- Updated PipelineOrchestrator to use NavigationMapperBrowserless
- All existing code continues to work without changes

#### 2. **BrowserQL (BQL) Integration** 
- Added BQL support to BrowserManagerBrowserless for enhanced debugging
- Implemented key methods:
  - `initBQLSession()` - Initialize BQL session with GraphQL
  - `getLiveURL()` - Get live debug URL from CDP
  - `autoOpenURL()` - Auto-open debug URL in browser
- BQL activates conditionally for:
  - Debug mode (`BROWSERLESS_DEBUG=true`)
  - Human-in-the-loop scenarios
  - CAPTCHA handling

#### 3. **Debug URL Fix**
- Fixed broken debug URL generation
- Initially tried JSON endpoint approach (didn't work - returned HTML)
- Upgraded browserless.io plan to support BQL reconnect feature
- Successfully implemented liveURL generation via BQL
- Debug URLs now auto-open in browser when `AUTO_OPEN_DEBUG=true`

#### 4. **CAPTCHA Detection Enhancement**
- Enhanced CAPTCHA event handling in BrowserManagerBrowserless
- Added detailed logging with CAPTCHA type, siteKey, URL
- Implemented analytics tracking:
  - In-memory sessionStats (detected/solved/failed counts)
  - CAPTCHA event storage for future MongoDB persistence
  - Success rate calculation
- Added support for multiple handling strategies:
  - Human intervention via liveURL
  - Automatic solving (if supported)
  - Custom handlers

#### 5. **Multi-Phase Price Comparison**
- Added `executePriceComparison()` to PipelineOrchestrator
- Implements smart two-phase approach:
  - **Phase 1**: Parallel price extraction without BQL (fast/cheap)
  - **Phase 2**: Single BQL session for checkout with liveURL (human-assisted)
- Cost-optimized strategy using regular sessions for extraction, BQL only when needed

### üîç Key Discoveries

1. **BQL Limitations**: Initial browserless.io plan didn't support `reconnect` feature required for BQL
2. **Correct Domain**: glasswingshop.com (not glasswing.shop)
3. **Navigation Extraction**: Successfully extracts categories from glasswingshop.com:
   - Clothing (41 items)
   - Man (32 items)
   - Woman (in progress)
   - 7 main navigation categories total

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

#### BQL vs Regular Browserless
- **Regular**: Direct Playwright connection, full control, no liveURL
- **BQL**: GraphQL interface, built-in stealth, automatic liveURL, reconnect capability
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use BQL for init, then Playwright for automation

#### Cost Considerations
- Regular sessions: ~$0.001/minute
- BQL uses same pricing as regular sessions
- Optimized by using BQL only when human interaction needed

### üìä Session Statistics
- Browserless.io working perfectly with upgraded plan
- Live debug URLs generating successfully
- Auto-open functionality operational
- CAPTCHA detection ready (0 detected so far)

### üöÄ Next Steps
- Test CAPTCHA handling with a site that has CAPTCHAs
- Implement MongoDB persistence for CAPTCHA events
- Continue with Week 1 Day 5 tasks from roadmap

### üìù Notes
- Debug mode is invaluable for development - can watch automation in real-time
- BQL integration positions us well for future human-in-the-loop features
- The system gracefully falls back when BQL features aren't available
