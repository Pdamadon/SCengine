# API to Bull Redis to Pipeline Orchestrator Flow Analysis Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive code review and flow mapping of the AI Shopping Scraper system, specifically tracing the complete data flow from API endpoints through Bull Redis queues to the pipeline orchestrator and strategy execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Flow Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive flow diagram and documentation that shows exactly how data flows from API request to final results, so that I can understand the system architecture and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reviews the documentation THEN they SHALL see a complete flow diagram showing all components from API to strategies
2. WHEN tracing a request THEN the system SHALL document each transformation and handoff point
3. WHEN analyzing the architecture THEN the documentation SHALL identify all key decision points and routing logic
4. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the analysis SHALL highlight potential bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

### Requirement 2: Component Interaction Analysis

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want detailed analysis of how each component interacts with others, so that I can identify coupling issues and architectural improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing component interactions THEN the system SHALL document all dependencies and data contracts
2. WHEN reviewing the queue system THEN the analysis SHALL show how jobs are prioritized and processed
3. WHEN examining the orchestrator THEN the documentation SHALL explain strategy selection and execution flow
4. WHEN evaluating the pipeline THEN the analysis SHALL identify all transformation points and data formats

### Requirement 3: Performance and Scalability Assessment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want analysis of performance characteristics and scalability bottlenecks, so that I can plan infrastructure and optimization efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing performance THEN the analysis SHALL identify potential bottlenecks in the flow
2. WHEN examining scalability THEN the documentation SHALL highlight horizontal and vertical scaling opportunities
3. WHEN analyzing resource usage THEN the system SHALL document memory, CPU, and I/O patterns
4. WHEN reviewing concurrency THEN the analysis SHALL explain parallel processing capabilities and limitations

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Resilience Review

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want comprehensive analysis of error handling and resilience patterns, so that I can ensure system stability and recovery capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing error handling THEN the system SHALL document all error paths and recovery mechanisms
2. WHEN reviewing resilience THEN the analysis SHALL identify retry logic and fallback strategies
3. WHEN examining monitoring THEN the documentation SHALL show all observability and alerting points
4. WHEN evaluating robustness THEN the analysis SHALL highlight potential failure modes and mitigations

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Maintainability Assessment

**User Story:** As a lead developer, I want detailed code quality analysis and maintainability recommendations, so that I can prioritize technical debt and improvement efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code quality THEN the analysis SHALL identify patterns, anti-patterns, and best practices
2. WHEN examining maintainability THEN the system SHALL highlight areas needing refactoring or improvement
3. WHEN analyzing architecture THEN the documentation SHALL suggest structural improvements
4. WHEN reviewing testing THEN the analysis SHALL identify gaps in test coverage and testing strategies
